# Ski_Game
The "Ski contest" project is wrriten in Java using the Swing class. The main purpose of it is to get to know and implement design patterns. The DP I implemented here are: Decorator, Deligator, Builder, Factory method, Prototype, Singleton, ThreadPool, and so..

This project is an actually ski contest simulator. the user can set the contest properties (number of contesters, arena details and so..). Eventually, the user starts the competition and on the screen there will be skiers images simulating the contest on a mountain slope image.
